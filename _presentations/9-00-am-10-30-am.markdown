- title: Introduction to Medical Device Security
  description: Today, it would be difficult to find medical device technology that
    does not critically depend on computer software. Network connectivity and wireless
    communication have transformed the delivery of patient care. The technology often
    enables patients to lead more normal and healthy lives. However, medical devices
    that rely on software (e.g., drug infusion pumps, linear accelerators, pacemakers)
    also inherit the pesky cybersecurity risks endemic to computing. What’s special
    about medical devices and cybersecurity? What’s hype and what’s real? What can
    history teach us? How are international standards bodies and regulatory cybersecurity
    requirements changing the global manufacture of medical devices? This talk will
    introduce attendees to the risks, benefits, and regulatory issues for medical
    device cybersecurity and innovation of trustworthy medical device software.
  speaker: Kevin Fu, Ph.D
