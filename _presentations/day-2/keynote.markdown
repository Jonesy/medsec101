**Medical Device Cybersecurity Through the FDA Lens**

Enhanced connectivity of medical technologies holds extraordinary promise for advancing patient care. Yet, with these benefits comes new kinds of threats—increasing cybersecurity risks. FDA encourages medical device manufacturers to carefully consider possible cybersecurity risks while designing medical devices and to have a plan to manage system or software updates. By focusing on cybersecurity during design, manufacturers can reduce vulnerabilities in their medical devices. But premarket considerations are only one aspect of medical device cybersecurity. While manufacturers can incorporate controls in the design of a product to help prevent these risks, it is essential that manufacturers also consider improvements during maintenance of devices, as the evolving nature of cyber threats and emergence of newly identified vulnerabilities means risks may arise throughout a device’s entire lifecycle.

A big part of effective cybersecurity is creating a proactive approach and fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration, which will help stay ahead of cybersecurity threats and protect patients.

This keynote session will provide an overview of the evolving medical device cybersecurity landscape with particular emphasis on what medical device ecosystem partners are presently doing to address current gaps as well as future challenges; a description of multi-stakeholder efforts; and regulatory policy under FDA’s premarket and postmarket authorities.
