Step back in time and join conference speakers and fellow attendees for a relaxing dinner at Epcot’s American Adventure Rotunda, where American history comes alive. We’ll meet at 6:15 at the conference center in the Grand Harbor Lobby and board buses that will take us to Epcot Center for the evening activities.
