Security does not have to cripple productivity or create financial stress. Security professionals across all industries have struggled for years to demonstrate return on investment (ROI) in support of their budgets. It doesn't work. And if security is improperly positioned—e.g., under IT—the budgeting struggle is a no-win proposition. In this entertaining and informative session, a former medical device manufacturer CISO will explain why sales, marketing, customer service, legal, audit, and the board of directors are the best partners for security and how to secure a seat at the table with other critical business functions. We will also explore a security investment model that is lean, progressive, adaptable to companies of any size/maturity level, and can demonstrate direct, positive impact on revenue.
