- title: Security as a Revenue Accelerator
  description: Security does not have to cripple productivity or create financial
    stress. Security professionals across all industries have struggled for years
    to demonstrate return on investment (ROI) in support of their budgets. It doesn’t
    work. And if security is improperly positioned—e.g., under IT—the budgeting struggle
    is a no-win proposition. In this entertaining and informative session, a former
    medical device manufacturer CISO will explain why sales, marketing, customer service,
    legal, audit, and the board of directors are the best partners for security and
    how to secure a seat at the table with other critical business functions. We will
    also explore a security investment model that is lean, progressive, adaptable
    to companies of any size/maturity level, and can demonstrate direct, positive
    impact on revenue.
