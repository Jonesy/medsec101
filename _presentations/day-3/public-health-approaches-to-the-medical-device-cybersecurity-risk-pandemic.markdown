Over the next 10 years, based on CDC health care encounter data, patients in the United States will experience more than an estimated 100 billion exposures to connected medical devices. This impressive estimate understates the exposure to connected devices because it excludes the rapidly growing home healthcare market, long-term care facilities, and other point-of-care sites. It further excludes non-regulated health and wellness devices and apps. This session will describe and explain how traditional public health best practices, including basic epidemiology, intervention program design, program evaluation, and program policy can be applied to define and address the technical, medical, and public health risks associated with the growing patient exposure to connected medical devices.
