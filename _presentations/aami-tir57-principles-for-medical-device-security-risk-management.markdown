Participants will learn how to perform security risk management for medical devices using the principles outlined in AAMI’s recently published technical report, AAMI TIR57: Principles for medical device security—Risk management. We will discuss the differences and similarities between security risk management and safety risk management, as well as how to integrate the two following practices outlined in ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971:2007(R)2010 Medical devices—Application of risk management to medical devices. We will also cover basic concepts in security as they apply to medical device security, such as threats and threat actors, vulnerabilities, assets, security risk, mitigation and risk treatment, single loss expectancy, annualized loss expectancy, confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Participants will work through a simplified example, applying the principles of TIR57. A short Q&A session will follow.

**All conference attendees will recieve a FREE copy of AAMI TIR57: Principles for Medical Device Security—Risk Management, which provides guidance for addressing information security within the risk management framework defined by ANSI/AAMI/ISO 14971.**
