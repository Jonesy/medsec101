        <p>Jack Kufahl was appointed to the role of UMHS Chief Information Security Officer in February 2016. Prior to this position, he spent 15 years with the University of Michigan Medical School and its information service operations. Jack began his career as a departmental systems administrator in the basic sciences, where he developed a healthy understanding of the academic enterprise. During his time with the Medical School, his role grew to include teams of approximately 100 staff and $13M in budgetary responsibility where he leveraged service-oriented delivery through partnerships with both distributed and centralized service providers. While perhaps an unconventional candidate for the CISO with his educational background in History and professional experience in the research departments, he applies the same motives of advancing customer service and process improvement to his new areas of accountability at the University of Michigan Health System.</p>
