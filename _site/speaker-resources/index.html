<p>Archimedes workshops and conferences bring together experts from industry, academia, and government who are passionate about our mission to improve medical device security. Our events focus on educating key stakeholders in the medical device and healthcare industries on current cybersecurity threats as well as solutions for preventing and resolving them.</p>

<p>Our events do not focus on the latest industry buzz or trendy new product development. We want our attendees to feel that they can speak freely about their cybersecurity issues with trusted and respected professionals who can help them establish best practices for improving medical device security in their products and organizations. At Archimedes, we provide a secure forum for industry leaders to gain a strong situational and operational awareness of emerging issues pertaining to cybersecurity and then we arm them with the knowledge to better protect both their clients and patients.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-submit-a-proposal">How to Submit a Proposal</h2>

<p>We are extremely selective in whom we invite to speak at Archimedes workshops and conferences. Our members recognize and appreciate that we maintain high educational standards. Please note that we do not accept sales pitches or marketing presentations for plenary talks.</p>
