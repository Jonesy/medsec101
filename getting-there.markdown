  body: The Medical Device Security 101 Conference will be held at <em>Disney’s Yacht
    & Beach Club Resorts</em> where you and your family can relax, swim, and enjoy
    easy access to Walt Disney World’s many parks and attractions. Designed in the
    tradition of a New England-style yacht club, __Disney’s Yacht & Beach Club Resorts__
    sit on Stormalong Bay—a 3-acre waterpark featuring pools, lagoons, waterslides,
    a lazy river, and a life-size shipwreck for young pirates to explore. The hotel
    is walking distance to Epcot and a mere boat-ride from Disney’s Hollywood Studios,
    placing you right in the heart of Disney’s premier attractions.
