## Join us at the Disney Yacht & Beach Club Resort

The Med Sec 101 Conference will be held at the Disney Yacht & Beach Club Resort where you and your family can relax, swim, and enjoy easy access to Walt Disney World’s many parks and attractions. Designed in the tradition of a New England-style yacht club, the Disney Yacht & Beach Club Resort sits on Stormalong Bay—a 3-acre waterpark featuring pools, lagoons, waterslides, a lazy river, and a life-size shipwreck for young pirates to explore. The hotel is walking distance to Epcot and a mere boat-ride from Disney’s Hollywood Studios, placing you right in the heart of Disney’s premier attractions.
