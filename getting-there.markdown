    & Beach Club Resorts</em> where you and your family can relax, swim, and enjoy
    easy access to Walt Disney World’s many parks and attractions. Designed in the

    is walking distance to Epcot and a mere boat-ride from Disney’s Hollywood Studios,
    placing you right in the heart of Disney’s premier attractions.
